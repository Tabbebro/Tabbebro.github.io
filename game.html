                    <br>Time Thrall has been my longest project so far.
                    <br>
                    <br>I did my internship for Need More Bullets while making this project.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea behind Time Thrall is that the player is awoken in a space ship and he must time travel to different times and fix the ship.
                    <br>
                    <br>I also started learning shaders during this project but sadly many of them didn't make it into the game.

                    <br>
                    <br>The menus were fully usable with mouse, keyboard & controller.
                    <br>
                    <br>There were animations, saving/loading, resetting, rebinding & much more in these settings.

                    <br>
                    <br>There was also a difficulty slider which allows player to take on harder missions with better loot.

                    <br>Arena Shooter Supreme or A.S.S for short was my first big project using Unreal Engine.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea behind A.S.S was that it was a retro arena shooter splitscreen game you could play with a friend.
                    <br>
                    <br>I started the project with almost 0 Unreal Engine and blueprint experience.

                    <br>For A.S.S I made the menus and settings. As this was my first time doing UI in UE it was a challenge to get started.
                    <br>
                    <br>I wanted to make these menus to look as retro as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>The menus for A.S.S were also 100% usable with mouse, keyboard & controller.
                    <br>
                    <br>I remember being annoyed with the key rebind system of UE so I made my own.

                <p>
                    <br>Sunescape was the first project where we got to polish it while studying in KAMK.
                    <br>
                    <br>Idea behind Sunescape was that you are a scientist that is escaping from a expanding star by hopping from space station to space station.
                    <br>
                    <br>I made the mission selection menu and the inventory system for Sunescape.
                    <br>
                    <br>We entered Sunescape to the Assembly Summer 2023 GameDev competition and placed 5th out of 12 participants.

                <p>
                    <br>I made the level selection for Sunescape.
                    <br>
                    <br>The level selection randomly selects the size & loot of the level.
                    <br>
                    <br>There was also supposed to be a sort of biome too but we didn't have time to make it.
                    <br>
                    <br>After completing a level there is chance to select from 2 or 3 different levels and sometimes there is only a 1 boss level.

                <p>
                    <br>The Inventory for Sunescape was were most of my time was used.
                    <br>
                    <br>I found some tutorial on how to make a basic grid inventory in Unity and I used it and expanded it a lot.
                    <br>
                    <br>Expansions I made were item stacking, splitting, dropping, picking up, equipping & swapping.
                    <br>
                    <br>I must say I'm still proud of this inventory and myself for making it.

                    <br>Top left shows player health and gravity gun charge amount.

                    <br>Bottom right shows equiped item and all of the ammo the player is carrying.

                <p>
                    <br>MehuSim was my first project where I've done anything with VR.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea behind MehuSim was that you are a person living in a so called Suicideflat (itsemurhayksi√∂) and you make some juice.
                    <br>
                    <br>I was tasked to make the side content for this project. E.g. Tv, Radio, Rat & the gun.
                    <br>
                    <br>There was also a plant that was supposed to make it into the project but I don't remember what happened to it.
                    <br>
                    <br>This is one of the projects I would love to try to make again but not in VR so more players could play it.

                <p>
                    <br>The TV in the room is fully usable and the buttons on it work as intended.
                    <br>
                    <br>It was my first time using MP4 files as textures and switching between them.
                </p>

                <h2>Gun</h2>
                <img src="images/projects/Mehu_Gun.gif" alt="mehu_gun" class="gif">
                <p>
                    <br>The Gun was a fun little thing to add into the project.
                    <br>
                    <br>I used the pickup system that was made by other programmers so the player could pickup the gun.
                    <br>
                    <br>I had to make a system which looked which hand had picked up the gun so the correct had could shoot the gun as this mechanic was not implemented in the pickup system.
                    <br>
                    <br>It was also fun to make the material fading for the darts of the gun.
                </p>

                <h2>Radio</h2>
                <img src="images/projects/Mehu_Radio.png" alt="mehu_radio" class="gif">
                <p>
                    <br>The radio was a bit trickier to make than it seems. This is because the knobs are interactable and to interact with them the player must rotate them.
                    <br>
                    <br>For my sanity our other programmer had made a similar system for the faucet in the bathroom. So I could use the same script with some little adjustments.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is pretty difficult showing the radio working, because I do not own a VR setup and voice is hard to show from a gif.

                    <br>
                    <br>During development of Moo Moo Madness I wanted to train my UI coding skills so I mainly did UI for this project.

                    <br>The store of Moo Moo Madness was pretty successfull in my oppinion.
                    <br>
                    <br>I made multiple different tabs to the shop.
                    <br>
                    <br>The thing which I'm most proud during this project was the cow skin customization. I remember that it was quite a difficult thing to do but I somehow managed to get it to work.

                    <br>Also during this project I learned how to save/load values.

                    <br>Entitled Roguelike Project (ERP) was the second project that I did during my studies.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea behind ERP was that the player wakes up in a sewer and he has to climb up the city to find their cat.
                    <br>
                    <br>ERP was the project where I managed to more than menus & settings as I also did the enemies, weapons & most of the weapons for the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>Also during ERP was the time when we decided that occasional building of the project was a good idea.

                    <br>
                    <br>The menus of the ERP are much cleaner than what I hade previously done, but looking back there are lots of simple mistakes.
                    <br>
                    <br>Saving/loading was still something I didn't have time to get into so when changing scenes all the values of settings go into their defaults.

                    <br>The weapons in ERP was my first time working on something other than UI during a project so I got some help from other programmer on our team.
                    <br>
                    <br>I managed to somehow make multiple different weapons and in my oppinion they work quite well.

                <p>
                    <br>The enemies were my biggest challenge during development of ERP as I wanted to try my skills and ask as little help as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>Because of my stubbornness the enemies are quite dumb. They do not have any kind of pathfinding and in some of the rooms it shows.
                    <br>
                    <br>At a later stage of development I wanted to add A* pathfinding algorithm to the enemies but our time was running out so I had to scrap that idea.

                    <br>Shank Simulator was my first school project that I have done.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea behind Shank Simulator was that there was an anime girl roadman which has been teleported to a different universe where she has to defeat different bosses to escape.
                    <br>
                    <br>The current build is broken because when we did this project we were all newbies on game development. Because of this we didn't have much knowledge on building and what to take into consideration when doing a build of a game.

                    <br>As Shank Simulator was my first project that I have made my knowledge of making stuff was 0 and for this project it shows.
                    <br>
                    <br>I was tasked of making the menus and settings for the game. Somehow I managed to get them to work but they are pretty scuffed if I do say so myself.
                    <br>
                    <br>Atleast the settings work, but there is no saving / loading because I didn't know how to do that.
